<h1 align="center" id="title">Seen</h1>

<p id="description">Seen is a photography-focused social media that allows users to upload original photos of artworks they have seen in real life. The goal of the app is to archive art that holds a physical presence in a public location. The philosophy of seen is that an artwork's value should not be based on its location author or academic opinion.</p>
